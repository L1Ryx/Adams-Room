# Adam's Room
Adam's Room is a rogue-like survival game set in a single forest clearing, blending eerie atmosphere and escalating tension. Your only goal: collect logs scattered around the map to keep the fire in the center burning. If the fire goes out, so do you. Each playthrough offers unique combinations of merchant items and hazardous events. The longer you survive, the weirder and more challenging the events become.

## Gameplay
- Log Collection: Gather logs to fuel the central fire and keep yourself alive. The fire is your only lifeline in the growing darkness.
- Merchant Visits: A mysterious merchant periodically arrives, offering random passive items. Enhance your gameplay with perks like increased movement speed or greater log capacity.
- Hazardous Events: Random events, such as wildfires or heavy winds, keep you on edge. As the night deepens, the events become increasingly bizarre and unsettling.
- Unfolding Lore: Dive into a narrative that blurs the line between dream and reality. The log-collecting sequence is revealed to be a dream—a fragile coping mechanism for the protagonist’s traumatic past. The sinister truth emerges as you progress.
